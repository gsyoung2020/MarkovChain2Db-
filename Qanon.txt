I'm so mad but I don't know why. I knew what side of things he would be on. I knew he would side with Putin just because he's friends with Trump and this just goes along with the test of the crazy ideas they all share with each other. I guess I just wanted a little peace in my life and now just writing that makes me feel so stupid and guilty, here is the Ukraine literally being invaded in war and im mad, I cant have peace in my home because my husband is a lunatic. How much more can I take, I truly don't know. I feel so stupid for engaging in the conversation I had, I knew better then to try and talk about world issues to a Q. Someone please help with any advice on how to stop engaging with Q people on war and world issues.

I haven't posted here for a long time now, because I thought things had gotten better with her. Honestly, it looked like she'd really calmed down with it all. She was focusing on her kids, her personal life, her health, etc.
Super quick version of events for the last 2 years; she was all about the fizzledrop (or whatever it's called) and the Save The Children stuff. It disgusted me, there was no taking her out of it until she crawled out of it herself. However, she's leaned back and forth from some conspiracy stuff, even some goalpost pushing herself.
She and I got into an argument a while back where I managed to get her to "drop her bullshit" as I call it. She ended up admitting to me, to my face, that she loves Trump specifically because he's an asshole and a bully.
So, I dropped her from my life for about a week until she came to me, in tears, begging me to forgive her and she apparently didn't know how bad that would hurt me. So, I opened back up to her because I'm a bleeding heart and an idiot.
There honestly wasn't anything else after that. I stayed off Facebook, she still grumbled about democrats every now and then. After her last 60 Day Facebook Ban, she seemingly cut the anti-dem crap.
Then bam. Last night, she's making posts about how the Russian Invasion of Ukraine is now all Biden's fault and she hopes all the Biden Voters (i.e. me) are proud of themselves. I tried to correct her (admittedly, I was the one who brought Trump into it), but she full-on told me to fuck off, all these Ukrainian lives are on Biden's hands, etc, etc.
Biden hadn't even said anything yet. It was HOURS before Biden's scheduled press conference. That was the last straw for me; people are dying and she lays them on Biden and acts as if Putin is just... I don't know, an animal who isn't at fault?
Have Q People moved past Trump this much? I can't get in her head anymore, other than she's so rabid against the Democrats, that she'd blame them for the weather. Unironically, might I add.
I really have no where else to ask this question. Is this what it is now, or is this a regular brand of... I don't even know what to call it.

I was in the Marine Corps some time ago. And I deployed to Afghanistan with a certain man who became as close as family to me. We eventually parted ways and lost contact. But I eventually reconnected with him on Facebook.
I was comfortable talking to my brother for a couple years after we reconnected. We could have long conversations about everything from politics to religion without either of us taking offense. Then the 2020 presidential election came around. He became aggressive and distant. He started quoting alt right YouTubers and activists. He actually blamed me for the outcome of the election. He was inconsolable.
It hasn’t gotten better since then. He has told me several, well, insane things. He’s told me that his child is in danger as long as he is in contact with me. He has repeatedly called me a sheep for refusing to take part in his political rants. He has berated me time after time. And, all the while, I have tried to maintain a relationship with him.
However, today I contacted him. I was seeking his honest opinion about a social matter in the hopes that he may actually have some insight that I didn’t. But I made the mistake of leading it with “I don’t feel like talking a lot about it”. I said that because I was trying to avoid a rant. I just wanted a simple one or two sentence opinion. Well, considering how outspoken he is, he decided to label me as weak for not wanting to engage in a passionate discussion. I, once again, am a beta man and sheep. I explained that I’m a more contemplative person. I don’t like to make rash judgments based on emotions. Then he berated me more.
I guess that a man, even a strong man, can only take so much. I informed him that he is the sheep. I told him that I’m proud to have avoided joining his cult. I said my goodbye. I doubt I’ll ever talk to him again. I wish I could say I am sad. But, after all of his bullshit, I am relieved. I hung on to our friendship as long as I could, but he is no longer the brother I knew in Afghanistan. That man may be gone forever.

himself when it comes to steering any conversation to heated political topics. 2) he refuses to get vaccinated and I am high risk. 3) He insists Trump will be reinstated on insert date, change date, change date. 4) He blamed us for the pandemic because we don't love thy neighbor as the bible says. If we didn't love our neighbor, why would we be wearing masks to protect people for years now? Well, now quite suddenly he is dying. He has 10% capacity of his heart working. Unfortunately, we can't go see him in the hospital and say goodbye because he would not get vaccinated. We drew a line and won't cross it when it comes to being near anti-vaxxers. Q took him and left a shell that only knows how to hate. That guy is unrecognizable compared to the caring, compassionate guy I've known for 30 years. Totally brainwashed and he will die alone.

My mom has changed a lot over the last year. She has always leaned towards the conservative side but was very respectful about different views. I think we started to lose the mom I knew about a year into Covid. She believes in the craziest crap. For example she thinks the burgers at Max Donald’s is actually dead babies( her words not mine). She is obsessed with the Child Sex Trafficking and suddenly for abused children when she emotionally and physically abused us at times growing up. We weren’t ever close but her polarizing views have really put a strain on what type of relationship I have with her. I am an adult with a learning disability working and going to school so right now I can’t afford to move out ( I live the north east where rent is super high so I’m saving up for my own place). She thinks Trump is the best and that Covid is nothing but the Flu and is an absolute Karen over masks. I’m feeling pretty helpless right now which makes me feel stupid considering Europeans are actually in the helpless position. I’m really struggling here any encouragement is much appreciated. Thanks

Hello everyone,

I am a communication and media studies student at Stetson University and I am currently conducting research on the role that online communities can play in our physical lives and relationships.

It has become increasingly clear that research needs to be conducted on the phenomena of losing loved ones to QAnon. Unfortunately, it is as devastating as it is poorly understood in the academic community.

Please feel free to message me or comment below if you are interested in participating in a digital interview with me. Interviews are easy and quick to set up. Your identity will be protected and you will be contributing to an academic conversation that has been long overdue.

I feel torn. Which makes me feel worse.
On the one hand, he's been a shitty Dad trying to ram Q and other conspiracies down my throat every time I visit.
On the other hand, he's my Dad. And when I was a kid he was the best Dad. When I was a teen he was an ok Dad.
Now he might have myeloma. He's been weak and confused for awhile but this is the first time the doc has put a name to it. He has a bone marrow biopsy to confirm next week but he has all the hallmarks of it.
I don't know how to feel.

My brother in law is Qanon and it’s starting to spread through my immediate family and it worries me so much. I’m not really sure if my parents buy into it as much as my brother in law does but that’s besides the point. I’m so scared for my nephew, he’s still under a year but my brother in law is already saying that he shouldn’t get vaccines and etc. fuck I’m not even just worried about that, I’m worried that he’s going to grow up believing this nonsense and seeing other people as lesser than him. Idk what to do, I want to pull them out of it so bad but I don’t think it’s possible

I'm feeling pretty speechless and confused and angry with my severely far gone qanon worshiping older brother right now.
He's always been interested in nonsense conspiracies and 'alternative facts' and has admittedly also always had a bit of a racist streak in him, but by and large he was pretty harmless and non offensive 95% of the time....that started changing pretty quickly though with Trump's big rise in the leadup to the 2016 election to now where he's completely gone off the deep end.

He pretty quickly became a full blown q converter and stopped going into work more and more often so he could spend more time watching youtube and talking to other fellow believers.
The arrival of covid really kicked it into high gear and he became more and more angry and outspoken with his views, culminating in him quitting work when vaccine mandates were introduced requiring him to be vaccinated to be able to carry on working.

Pretty soon after he went on a big road trip for a few months with the excuse of needing to just get away to clear his head and calm down a bit....he came back and though still a full blown believer was at least less vocal about it and seemingly spruiking less insane conspiracies...
Fast forward to this past weekend when i was catching up with him at a family dinner where he decided to share his newest interest with everyone - as usual, more q nonsense annnnnnd full blown neo nazi rallies

After being politely told by my mum, my other (also far right supporting) older brother and I that we didn't want to watch or hear about any of that and following an unsuccessful attempt to get him to talk about some of his old non batshit hobbies he started ranting about jews, blacks, race traitors and pedophile elites and stormed out on us.

It's been a few days but I still feel shocked and depressed as it seems he's now well and truly too far gone for us to pull him back to some semblance of his old 'normal' self.


My mothers best friend of 40 years has gone headfirst into this whole conspiracy around “globalists” and all the various conspiracies that naturally come along with it that seem to fall under the Q umbrella of conspiracies. We have tried to convince them otherwise but I’m afraid they really buy into it wholeheartedly. The really painful part is so many of these conspiracies revolve around globalism which is really vailed antisemitism…and well…my whole family is Jewish. They attended my wedding for goodness sake. We were all close and I loved them so much growing up but I just cannot be friends with people who would spread conspiracies so harmful to my own community and deny that these are so harmful. Just feeling kind of lost as to how to help bring them back from this really weird and hurtful place. They were not the sort of people I would have ever expected to fall for this stuff. My mother is still arguing with them but it just seems like no use.

I have this friend that I've known for years and it's getting really hard to talk to her. I miss just asking her questions without her having to whip out her tarot cards or how something relates to the Universe. She hasn't said if she is into Qanon and has told me she doesn't believe in conspiracy theories but she has said to me before how she browsed their Facebook group pages and looked at some of their content. She refuses to get vaxed and thinks the government is out to get her. If you believe a crystal can help you or guide you, isn't that a conspiracy theory? Not everything has to relate to the Universe and people deal with their own shit in certain ways.

She's even had a spiritual awakening and says the Great awakening is happening and people will start to wake up. Wake up from what exactly?


I'm fighting back tears right now. I haven't seen my sister in a year. Last time I saw her, she told me she didn't need me in her life because I told her there were no lizard men controlling the liberal media. I came back to visit family and she and I talked tonight. She and I sat down with our mother, a major Qultist, and my sister started talking about how she regrets having voted for Trump and that she feels like she got out of a daze. As we were both talking about how we feel used and abused by the political division in this country, I watched our mother wriggle with discomfort and check her phone. But my sister and I had this deep connection that we haven't had in years. She drove me to my hotel and stayed to talk for hours. She broke up with her fiance (also a Qultist) and started making new friends. She's dating a balanced guy, now, and working as an elementary school teacher. I am so proud of her and so happy she's come out. I didn't do anything to help her get out, I really just thought she was gone. I'm just so happy to have my sister back.

He’s not gone yet but he’s getting there.

The awkward silences after he drops another wild take are getting longer and even worse it’s happening while we’re hanging out with his own family. We all just let whatever he says hang and hope he drops it, which thankfully he’s always done.

He’s not talking about the Illuminati (yet) but he’s unvaxxed and talks mostly about American politics even though we’re Canadian.

I hate that I'm starting to resent him when he starts talking about all this nonsense. I hate that I feel embarrassed by him. I hate that all I can think about while he’s repeating something he heard online is “god, what a fucking idiot”.

He wasn’t like this 4 years ago. He’s a great boyfriend when Q stuff isn’t the topic of discussion, and even when it is he’s never yelled or directed anything at me. It’s like he’s momentarily possessed and is back to normal a few minutes later. I still think he’s a smart guy with a curious mind, I just hate that he’s been suckered into this mess because he’s scared.

He told me after his ex burned him with a bad breakup he was briefly sucked into the MGTOW circles but he was able to get out of that which gives me hope that he can get out of this. I KNOW why all this Q stuff is so appealing for him right now, and I know there has to be some way to get him back.

I know he’s not too far gone but I don’t know how to help him. I know it’ll need to be slow and gentle but I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like time is running out, with the way he’s going he’ll be full Q by the end of the year and I’ll have to be gone by then.

Is there anything I can do for him ?

My dad has never mentioned Q specifically. He hasn't said anything about the sex trafficking stuff that a lot of Q's believe in. He's very much anti-mask, anti-vax, pro-trucker convoy, etc. We have this agreement in my family not to talk politics because during the 2016 election there were arguments over politics. So I obliged. I never bring up politics. My dad constantly does, still. I live in Minneapolis and when the George Floyd murder went down, I couldn't even talk to him about it at all because he as making it political and spewing bullshit about the city that he's seen on social media. Telling me I'm wrong about things when I live here and am involved in the community and have seen with my own eyes.
Today I realized I can no longer just have a simple conversation with him. This disinformation culture is now embedded into his identity. He never once asked me about my health (was recently diagnosed with an auto-immune disorder), never asked about my job, my life, my pets, my partner - nothing. Just spewed this story of him acting like man-karen about masks at a freaking high school!! He is a delivery driver and apparently really "stuck it to them!" at the high school. Masks are required and he apparently refused to wear his and got into it with the administrator and resource officer about it.
I guess I'm wondering, how do you get through to someone who has this infestation of disinformation lodged so deeply inside of them that they are no longer themselves? How do I even begin a conversation? Ideally I'd love to go NC but my mom and I are really close and I'm afraid of the stress it will bring to her. I feel hopeless. Like I'm climbing this giant hill that just keeps going up and up. Any insight? I've already tried fact-checking but that doesn't work when they literally are living in a different reality. I don't even care to change his mind, I just want to encourage him to not rely solely on right-wing fake news. Also...any helpful boundary setting tips would be greatly appreciated! How do I respond when he breaks that boundary of no politics talk? I am always painted as the aggressor in my family because my viewpoints differ from most of my family's.

I'm in family therapy with my q-ish, anti vax mom, and our therapist was able to get us to agree to meet with our family doctor, a source who we both know and trust, to address her vaccine concerns. She did not like this idea, thinking that our doctor wouldn't know the "truth" about vaccines that my mom has uncovered these last few years. However, she thankfully agreed because she is committed to making our strained relationship better.
What questions would you ask during this appointment that might help spark some doubt that the vaccines are not an ineffective, murderous weapon that was only created to make the rich richer?

Hello!

Earlier today the mods (upon whom praise shall be heaped) have tasked me to create a regular hubspot for venting related submissions.

Lé mods (praise be) have informed me that this is to be done in order to recognise and highlight the flood of negative interactions with Qultists by those around them.

Per the above, to compensate there will be a relaxation of rules and guidelines, except for rules regarding tacit approval of anyone's death and Reddit's own ToS. The rules will remain as per standard everywhere else.

My task for the next week or two is to create this post every 24 hours. After that the frequency may change or I may be destroyed and sold for scrap as per my generous creator's instructions (praise be).

I’ve posted here before and always find this sub really helpful to turn to. Long story (everyone here knows too well already) short, my mum is into all the Q stuff. She’s never said Q anon to me but the things she believes seem to be all the same as the Q theories. It’s been really hard and our relationship has been severely impacted, but lately it’s actually been a little better with her, she seems to have realized she’s not changing my mind and when we talk she manages to not turn conversation to conspiracies. But now I’m struggling with my anxiety again because of how many strangers or other people I encounter in my life seem to be believing this stuff too. I own a shop and last week we had a talker from the Q rallies come in and tell us all who’ve had the vaccine will be dead in 3-5 years. I don’t believe in that stuff and my logical mind knows I should just not fixate but being an anxious person is making that increasingly difficult. It seems like other people I know/care about are starting to fall for this shit too, or at least they’re entertaining it more. I don’t know how to cope when it feels like at this point it’s a 50/50 split of covid hoaxers and people who don’t buy any of it. I guess I just need some reassurance that there are still loads of people out there who don’t think the Queens a lizard and all the vaccinated are gonna die.
Today I’m just feeling so dragged down by it all and my depression has been creeping back in peaks and troughs for the past couple of years, I feel like either way I lose. Either I’ll die in 3-5 years from the vaccine or I’ve lost my close relationship with mum and the world is fucked for no good reason. I said before things have been better with Ma and they have, but we’re nowhere near as close as we used to be and I don’t feel like we ever will be again.
Ps. For context I live in the UK, it’s getting real bad over here too. And also, sorry this is so long

Hi everybody! Long time lurker and first time poster in this sub and I’m interested if anyone has had a similar experience to mine.
I’ve struggled with alcohol use disorder and binge drinking for most of my adult life. I was in and out of AA since 2014 and my drinking negatively impacted many interpersonal relationships.
I became a mom a couple years ago and started to take getting sober “for good” a lot more seriously. I signed up for some “life coaching” with this lady who had had a similar experience to mine with alcoholism and who was also a sober moma.
She was a cool person in a lot of ways and because I was working my 12 steps I told her a lot of personal things that nobody else knows.
Anyways through our conversations and on her socials I started seeing little hints that something wasn’t right. Weird stuff about the elite being child molesters, anti vaxx/anti mask stuff, I remember she brought up ANTIFA once after I told her something pretty personal and it kind of made me raise an eyebrow. I held my nose on it because in general sobriety groups non non-political (it’s one of AAs traditions).
After RBG died she said something about her date of death being faked to fall on a high Jewish holiday and that was the moment I noped out mentally. RBG was a personal hero of mine and it was totally disrespectful and tone deaf. I didn’t say anything but just kind of backed off with her after that.
Part of this coaching was a virtual group with other women who would meet once per week and talk. Some were sober and others just ladies who wanted to chat with other ladies. Some of these ladies were also Q anon sympathizers and it was just yuck.
Anyways I’m in Canada so the trucker convoy has been all over the news. After spending Friday morning watching 3 different journalists on 3 different news channels get either harassed or assaulted I posted something on IG that was basically like, “if you agree with this behavior, please go ahead and unfollow”.
They’re all gone now. People who were so important when I first got sober, who know so much personal stuff about me, just quickly dropped me because I’m not ok with assaulting journalists and bringing small children into an active police operation (both things that happened in Ottawa over the weekend). It hurts but it wasn’t unexpected.
I know I need to get back to good ole AA and leave the life coaching thing behind me, but I see how Q preys on vulnerable people and it has me looking at all my sober friends with suspicion.
Thanks for reading my post. Love to you all.

I'm afraid that I may be losing another sibling to this BS. I'll give a bit of background on my youngest sister. She is in remission after having been treated for lung cancer a few years ago, and she also has COPD. She wouldn't likely have a good outcome if she was to get COVID. She has always worn a mask when out, but she does socialize quite a bit, and I don't think she wears a mask then. Only one of her three adult children is vaccinated, and she socializes with them all of the time. She did get the first two vaccines, but now she is refusing to get the booster. She claims that she doesn't want to get it, because she has heard of people getting sick from it. She didn't get sick from the first two, and my husband and I both got the booster, and we didn't get sick from it, or from the other two.
She has always taken the virus somewhat seriously, but I've noticed some changes in her attitude lately. I'm thinking that it's because she is in regular contact with my Qsister. She has on her FB page a picture of Snoopy sitting in a yoga pose, and it says 'Exhale Fear'. I didn't think too much of that, although a small flag went up in my mind when I saw it. Today she posted a meme that says, "Children need dirt and germs, NOT masks and sanitizer." Underneath the words are two drawings of sheep. Okay. That is definitely a warning sign if you ask me! She has always told me that she doesn't agree with our Qsister, that she agrees with me, but I can't help but think that she is being brainwashed into believing the anti-vax BS that my Qsister spews.
Now that she is refusing the booster, her protection is surely waning, so she will be at a much greater risk if she contracts the virus.
A friend of mine got the virus around Christmas time. She also has COPD. She was fully vaccinated, even boosted, but the virus attacked her lungs anyway. She's been in the hospital ever since, and almost died a couple of times. Now they say that she needs lung transplants in order to survive. If the virus affected her like that, why wouldn't my sister be similarly affected? I know we're all different, but they both have damaged lungs, so I can't help but think that their outcomes might be similar.
Anyway, what do you guys think? Is my sister going down the rabbit hole with my Qsister? I've already had to cut my Qsister completely out of my life. I really don't want to have to cut another sister out of my life too, but if she ends up becoming another Qsister, I won't have any choice.

Hi! I really need advice on how to talk to my mother about me being vaccinated. Long story short I am taking a month long trip to volunteer in Europe in a few months(Covid dependent) and to do so I need to inform my mother that I am vaccinated since I just turned 18 and live under her roof and can’t avoid the topic since most of Europe is shut down to people who aren’t vaccinated. I’ve managed to avoid confrontation until now about how I don’t agree with her qanon beliefs but I’m afraid she will kick me out or worse if I tell her this. Any advice on how I can “soften the blow” or just avoid making things worse than they need to be?

My brother is a QAon’er and I have tried to see what the deal is. He believes crazy ass shit and thinks I’m delusional for not believing in what he does. He says he has all this information from telegram? And all this proof?! Biden is a puppet, the earth is flat, trump is a prophet, the deep state controls everything, liberals rape and turn kids into sexual slaves, etc.
I’m just curious if anyone has similar experiences, and I can’t even talk to my brother anymore, because I am a sheep and his eyes are open lol. We used to be close and he is sucked into this shit.

This isn't a full on q story, but I am so upset and haven't been able to stop thinking about a conversation I had with my daughter a few nights ago.
I knew she was vaccine hesitant, but since she usually respects my opinions on things, I thought I would be able to get through to her. What I got was a brick wall.
She told me that she is not getting the vaccine because it changes your DNA, and that people who got it are so afraid of this virus that they are willing to take anything. I was really hurt, I don't understand how she could think this of me.
She also believes that the U.S. government is covering up vaccine deaths. They can do that because they don't have vaccines worldwide. (???)
Psychologists tell us to ask questions about their delusions to try to bring them out of it, but she turned that tactic on ME, asking me questions I can't answer well because I'm not a doctor or scientist. She had me stuttering and repeating myself. I also went off on some tangents that complicated everything. I kept asking her to ask her doctor.
She claims not to watch the news (doesn't trust the media), claims she doesn't get on social media, yet doesn't realize she's getting all her info from her husband and MIL, who do get their info on social media. She also claims to be very careful, yet she's had Covid twice in 4 months. Planning a trip to Florida, and letting her unvaxxed MIL visit after an international flight does not sound "safe" to me, especially when she has two kids under five.
I also learned during that conversation that my son has been lying to me and also is not vaccinated. What the hell?
I'm so angry and sad that I don't want to talk to either of them again any time soon.
I despise the people who are spreading disinformation and breaking up families.
Sorry this is so long, thanks for listening.

That's horrible. I'm so sorry you have to deal with it.
I'm not an expert. And I don't have many answers. Others on here can be more helpful.
But I'll give you the same advice I give everyone. Try not to dwell on it. Getting worked up over things you can't change will only hurt you. I know it's hard. And it feels like you need to go over it again and again. But you need to try to distract yourself. Don't let it destroy you. There is a time to deal with things. And a time when you can do nothing. Don't spend that time dwelling on what you can't change. It will only hurt you.
That advice helped me. I hope it helps you. I wish I could do more. But I'm as lost, or more so, than you are. Good luck. And look after yourself. Don't dwell on what you can't change.

I made a deal with myself. The only time I allow myself to worry is waiting for someone to get out of surgery. Otherwise, it's a waste of time bc if we can't control an outcome, then that's it. My older son has been in NC with me for a couple of years and I wrote him a goodbye letter in case something happens to me. It's heartbreaking & something only another parent can understand. In the coming years, I hope the rebound against this dark-ages mentality is tremendous. Peace, mom

My mom has been drifting into Q territory since Covid started. But she's not there yet. She is still open to seeing/hearing evidence contrary to her claims. I'm trying to find info to debunk one of her main claims:
I can't remember the exact name, but some prominent scientist claimed that the virus had lab-based origins, then Fauci gave a several million dollar grant to said scientist, then they "changed their minds" and publicly said it is NOT from a lab.
Doing research, I found a scientist that fits the bill, Kristian Andersen, but I can't find ANY information on a grant given by the NIH. And Andersen actually goes into a lot of detail of how he wasn't totally sold on the lab theory and that he changed his mind because he looked further into it.
Does anyone here have any source on this? I suspect it might have come from RFK's 800 page long book about Fauci, which she read. I'm not going down that rabbit hole, but if anyone knows a source for any fact checks on that book, I'd love that. A cursory Google search gave me nothing.

I’m sorry for the long post; I have a lot of bottled up feelings about this and not many people to talk to about it.
My mom isn’t full-on Q - at least not that I’m aware of - but believes in the Deep State, believes the election was stolen, and is extremely anti-vax. When my sister had to get the vaccine for school, my mom went with her to ensure they weren’t putting a tracker on her.
For context, we have a complicated relationship. We were pretty close prior to COVID. Tensions slowly grew from the lockdown into the summer of 2020. After she found out I attended a BLM protest, she told me she had failed as a mother and I was on my own. I wound up staying at someone else’s place for a short time. Eventually, she (sort of?) apologized for saying that and I returned home, but things haven’t been the same since. We don’t discuss anything remotely political anymore, but there’s a distance between us that wasn’t there before COVID.
Things have been pretty much fine until recently. I’m graduating from college soon, and my school is requiring everyone at my graduation to be vaccinated, guests included. When I asked her what she’s going to do about that, she told me a doctor is going to give her a fake vaccine card for free. I made it clear to her that I was upset by that. She said she would take a COVID test beforehand, but absolutely won’t take the vaccine. I didn’t want to press any further because I don’t want our relationship to deteriorate again.
I went to my dad to get his thoughts (he isn’t vaccinated, but wants to be and is afraid of my mom’s reaction) and he said he didn’t want to be involved in that discussion. I was hoping he might sway her, but since he won’t, should I try to change her mind or is it simply not worth it?
UPDATE: I have decided to tell her that if she doesn’t get vaccinated, I don’t want to go to my graduation. If that doesn’t sway her, I will either attend without her, or celebrate privately. I’m incredibly thankful for all of your advice and support. It really means a lot.

This is driving me absolutely wild. My mom and dad have been divorced since I was 7 and I am 30 now. My dad was against Trump and all that jazz and thought people were crazy who supported him. Fast forward to last year all of a sudden he believes ivermectin is the cure for covid and that natural immunity is the best route. He follows these fake doctors on YouTube. And I begged him in a nice way to get vaccinated and he snapped at me hard and I got upset and told him his ability to not be able to critically think stems from having a narcissistic abusive mother growing up ( which everyone agrees she is ) and apparently that hurt his feelings and i apologized to him. Ever since then though he won't really talk to me at all. I had major surgery and he didn't even offer to come over and see me. I've sent him texts and songs and he hasn't replied. So I just said whatever. This was two months ago.
Fast forward to last week when the FREEDUMB convoy came to my part of the Maritimes ( Canada ) and I did a drive by on my way to an appointment and I gave them the middle finger and posted on FB " go home you bunch of babies " and my step mother who had told me before in the past that " your father told me if I asked him to get vaccinated he would but I support and respect your father so I won't ask him to". Anyway she commented on my Facebook post and said " we were there!" And my friend commented saying why would you be there ? Why aren't you out protesting about things that actually matter and not stand with a bunch of neo nazi " and my step mother told me that I was just a user and got everything out of my dad and her so that's why I can be disrespectful. She was referring to the car that's in her name that I've been making payments on and only missed a payment when I was recovering from surgery. She told me before all the shit hit the fan that if I needed her to cover a payment it would be fine but then she used it against me when I did need help. The only thing I said to her on my FB post was if she truly thinks I'm a user she needs to remove me from FB.
and then..... Still reeling from all this BS. My grandmother called me and I knew my mom was teetering on the edge of insanity. Anyway my grandmother called me and said your mother has lost it. She told my grandmother that we are under Marshall law in Canada and Trudeau is turning Canada into a military country. And she said that we are pre WW2 and equated this with the Holocaust. My grandmother said she had to hang up because she was gonna freak out.
There's so much more but I'm so fucking disgusted with my parents. I keep thinking I'm being dramatic sometimes but ya know.. I don't think I am really. My boundary is if you're gonna go down and stand with a protest with upside down flags and nazi symbols on the flags ( plus way more ) then you have no part in my life. I am mourning the loss of bo

Hey, all.
My girlfriend is a high-ranking Army officer. I'm also in the Army. I was enlisted, but enlisted and officers can't date so I am becoming an officer.
Her job is pretty perfect. She works from 7-11AM every day and only has a day or two of actual work to do every month. The rest of the time, she has downtime/personal time on the clock where she reads, plays tabletop games with her section, watches Netflix, etc. Her salary is around 80k-ish annually. She hasn't worked in the office for like six weeks because of Covid, and there hasn't been work, so it's literally just been a paid vacation. She's been traveling, hanging out with friends, visiting family, etc.
The military requires us to get the vaccine. She will get kicked out if she does not get it. She has next to no stress, next to no work, gets really good benefits, she's halfway to retirement (at 28), she has a master's degree she can only use here, she gets treated well and likes everyone there, she lives in the middle of nowhere (so jobs are not really a thing) but the base is close to her, other jobs will make her get the vaccine, she gets paid really well for next to nothing, I became an officer for her but before I commission she'll be leaving (which I'm upset about), she's throwing away her life's work, etc etc. She's being high-key dumb. Her plan is to work at an Amazon warehouse (she is a small girl, too) for like $14.50/hour after she gets out.
Initially she thought that the vaccine had dead babies inside of it (and I get that with J&J this is true to an extent, but not with Pfizer or Moderna). I cracked that theory. She then started clinging to how it was the "Mark of the Beast '' and I debunked that theory with Revelations, too. She had to write an essay for her leadership on her stance and it's honestly just "stuff". She disregarded the positives, dug deep for the few things that would help her hold a stance against it, and clung to them. When she wrote that essay, it was just stuff. No points, no connections, no meaning, no relation, literally just shit thrown at a wall to see what would stick. Her rejection of it is philosophical and political (which are two cases that the Military said they would NOT acknowledge for exemptions). She also got like 17 or something shots when she first joined and none of them bothered her at all, plus she's needed to get 4-5 shots a year for the past decade.
She's clinging to this out of stubborn-ness. She says it gives her an excuse to talk about God. I also feel like she lacks the humility to be able to say "you're right, I was misled, I'll get it". I can imagine she will be embarrassed to swap sides when everyone in her unit has been bullying her into getting it.
I learned that I am the only pro-vaccine person in her life. The others that are pro-vaccine have been bullying her and treating her like shit so she has wanted to resist it to spite them.
I can imagine you guys are going to tell me to leave her but that's not what I am here for. I want help persuading her to get it. If she throws this away, I might actually leave her, but I want to have a talk with her where I throw all of the ammo at her so that I possibly can try to change her mind before letting her go.
She is super religious (Baptist, hates Catholics, so she won't listen to the Vatican) so if you guys can help me come up with arguments that use the Bible as a common ground, I would appreciate it.
TL;DR: My girlfriend has her dream job in her dream career and she's throwing it away because of stubbornness. I know you guys are going to tell me to dump her, but I really, really want help constructing a compassionate/logical/spiritual "Hey, I understand, but you should really get it. Here's why" talk before I actually dump her. Any arguments, please, send me information, resources, and stances I can take with her. I want to change her mind, not berate her!

Hey all,
Have any of your Q-friends and/or family members been convinced that ALL debt will be erased in a matter of months? My mom was on the NESARA scam train last year. I have limited contact with them since they've gone off the deep end; but lately I have to talk to them about student loans they cosigned. They FINALLY agreed to help me refinance with a 3rd party for my private loans (I'm not in a position to qualify on my own at the moment) - but only when I pointed out it would save them money as well.
As an adult, I know my parents are horrible with money. They racked up a lot of debt when my sister and I were younger. When I was quite literally a starving senior in college, they actually asked to borrow money from me so my dad could buy a plane ticket for work. Meanwhile, my sister was living at home, rent free, and making an 'adult salary' working at a bank. When I suggested they ask her, they said they were too embarrassed (I was always the scapegoat). But, I'm getting off topic.
While I am kinda clinging to the possibility of some form of student debt relief from the government, I am NOT banking on it. At this point, I've accepted that I'll probably rent my whole life and make loan payments till I die. My parents are "supportive" right now by agreeing to be a cosigner; but they also genuinely believe all debt is going to disappear. They genuinely believe any taxation is tyranny now. It's bizarre.

Some backstory: me and my cousin are around the same age and grew up together and up until last year were very close. We had even talked about moving in together and would hang out multiple times a week.
Since the pandemic started she has slowly been falling deeper into conspiracy theories and is extremely antivax (which I found out last year). She left her job because they introduced a vaccine mandate. Her whole family (mom, dad, sister, grandparents) are all antivax as well with her mom being the most extreme and deep into it. She literally will not believe any actual scientific information about the vaccine and gets all of her information from facebook posts. I haven’t seen her in person for a while because my mom has cancer and is immunocompromised and I don’t want to risk it.
My last straw was her posting that she was a part of the anti vax convoy and I deleted her and her family off all social media. I haven’t answered her last few texts which I feel guilty about since one of them was just her checking in on me. I know it’s immature to completely ignore her, but it just makes me so upset and I can’t handle any more stress right now.
Should I text her and explain why I don’t want to speak to her anymore? Or should I wait for her to text me? Or should I just ignore her altogether?
Another note: I don’t want to fight with her or try to convince her she’s wrong because I think she’s too far gone and i just don’t have the energy anymore

After my QDad went to the trucker convoy in Ottawa on January 29th, things have not been good. I live with my parents and I left home on the Wednesday before the weekend of the convoy because I had a big blowout with my family and I knew I needed to get out of the house and away from my dad. I stayed with my friend from work for 2 weeks so that I could mentally get better and because if my dad got covid at the event, I did not want to risk having to miss work and self-isolate. In these two weeks, I was able to secure a group of friends to live with in May, which really came in a time of need. I also gained a lot of clarity being away from home.
Then I moved back home on February 11th. This is when things went downhill. I mistakenly thought that things would be different when I got home because my dad had a chance to think things over. Now, I obviously didn't think he would change his opinions but I expected the constant Fox News, Dan Bongino, Facebook videos, "research", the list goes on, to stop when I was around. He knows hearing that shit triggers me and upsets me yet he still chooses to watch things when I am in earshot and he completely disregards how I feel about it. I have been living with my parents for the last two years since graduating college.
The past two weeks, the convoy has taken over downtown Ottawa and my dad is obsessed at this point as they are finally getting these people out of the city. He, of course, is pulling the "police brutality" card even though everyone was given fair warning days in advance that if they don't leave Ottawa then they risk being arrested. I digress.
Fast forward to yesterday. My brother and his girlfriend were coming over for brunch at my parents place and it was shaping up to be a nice afternoon. My dad was making brunch and my mom and my brother's girlfriend went to the store. I was sitting in the living room knitting and my dad sat in the kitchen. He proceeded to play a video of someone saying how masks don't work and how Ryerson University did some study on it blah blah blah. I asked him politely if he could watch the video in another room. He told me that it is his house and he can watch whatever he wants, wherever he wants. This spun into a big yelling match and then my mom got home. We calmed down and tried to move on but I was so mad and exhausted from arguing that I told my mom that I just wanted to be alone and was no longer hungry. My mom asked me if she could do anything to help and I said we could talk in another room. We went upstairs to talk and this is when she suggested that she was thinking about separating from my dad.
The way she spoke about it was so calm. I could tell she had been thinking about it for a while. She didn't cry or look upset. She spoke about her hardships in her life and tried to relate to me by speaking about her troubled relationship with her father. She told me that the man she married is a different man then the one she is married to. For the first time, she was telling me the truth. I felt as though she never wanted to say anything against my dad because she wanted to protect their marriage but now all her cards were on their table and I didn't have to feel crazy anymore for feeling so angry and sad all the time. I went to work after that.
This morning was weird. I barely spoke to my dad although he was around the house. My mom and I went to run errands together for most of the day and we spoke a lot more about everything. She told me how unhappy she had been and how she can no longer relate to my dad at all. She said that they have almost nothing in common anymore and that most of the time, benign topics end up in an argument. She spoke about her plan to sell the house, get a condo and live on her own. We discussed logistics of who would get what between them in the separation. She told me that she would talk to him about it at dinner while I was working tonight. At 9:30, I texted my mom from work to ask her how the conversation went and she told me that it wasn't good and that he left to stay with my aunt.
At this point, I know I need to speak with my mom tomorrow but I don't know how I feel about it yet. I am a very emotional and sensitive person yet I haven't cried about it at all. I was able to go to work today and not think about it much. I don't know whether I'm relieved, sad, scared, angry. I'm happy for my mom but I am definitely worried that this will send my dad over the edge. I'm scared that he'll completely fall off the deep end of QAnon if he has complete access to it and no pushback from anyone. I guess I'll have to wait and see what happens.

The day that I've been dreading is coming. My (21F) QDad is going to his first antivax rally with my aunt and her friends. He just told me that he's going on Saturday to a big antivax rally being held in my city. There will be probably around 5-10 thousand anti-vaxxers there and I'm fucking pissed and terrified at the same time. I live with my parents and if you have read my last posts regarding my QDad, you will know that it's been really hard. My mom doesn't agree with any of his radical beliefs but she doesn't outwardly disagree like I do and she does nothing to stop him from spiraling even more. He watches Fox all day, every day and does his "research". He is unemployed, his whole life revolves around the so-called "truth". I work a full time job and if he goes to do this thing, you bet I'm not going to be able to go to work without a negative test because I, like the decent person I am, do not want to infect my coworkers and all the residents in the building I work in. It's so fucking exhausting having to feel like I need to constantly be on the lookout for the next crazy and dangerous thing my dad is going to do. I hate how he makes me feel like I'm the one who won't listen to him and I'm the one who doesn't see what's "really going on". It's so infuriating because of how twisted that is. It's so completely the opposite that it actually makes me feel crazy. It's not fair that I can't live my life without the QCloud floating over my head all the time.

I know I will never be the person I was. All I feel is darkness. I already have depression/anxiety to begin with, since I was 11. But I feel now like this is my permanent state. I’m seeing a therapist. She says I am going through the stages of mourning - sadness, guilt, anger, denial etc. I have nightmares every night of being in a car and dropping my Qdad off at the side of the road and abandoning him and waking up crying cause I will never see him again. My future has been changed and not for the better.

Long time caller. sorry.
Perhaps just a note to piece together my thinking. feel free to comment but I guess I'm getting frustrated that my idea that as restrictions lifted and life got back to normal then my partner might ease themselves out of this. I guess I'm starting to feel that might be wrong.
I can't help testing the waters every now and then but the mention of something about COVID has them ranting about how persecuted they are and how everyone thinks that they are stupid or deluded but that they see the light and know what is happening and how they are ( in their work) dealing with all these sudden deaths and babies dying etc.
It's true.. they are dealing with people's Trauma in their work and some of that is people blaming COVID but then they also read every sudden death in the media as because of the vaccine ( I guess their social media tells them that .. or they fill in the blanks.) 
They are developing some other interests and activities (but those are also heavily involving social media and few other real people in person.) I don't know how to change that as they seem even more introverted and unwilling to socialize.
My wonder is whether they will perhaps never change. I fear that eventually they will get COVID .. I don't know how they would interpret the experience and I feel guilty for wanting to get on and re-engage with society and the outside world whenever that involves us being in a crowd. They interpret it as me being fearful of the crowd but actually I'm fearful of them in the crowd.. not myself.
When they rant they describe all my friends and family like me as evil, stupid, acuse them of abuse of children and pick things out to turn them into the most evil people alive. But now afterwards they become guilty I think for how they treat me and what they have said .. ( in between they also said my family are beautiful people) so it all feels like randomness dredged up.
I try to listen to their fear and anger and let them vent and try to see if they will explore their feelings. They say that I must be wrong because I lack the fire and conviction that they have that they are right and don't challenge them and tell them ( I feel past that.. it didn't work) maybe they are angry that I am moving on and getting back to enjoying other parts of my life that they don't seem able to.
I just wonder how long this will all take. will their refusal to be vaccinated end in tragedy .. or further denial. Can I put up with the isolation I feel or negotiate around it to keep it bearable. .. catching up with friends and doing social activities that I enjoy.
Their conviction and beliefs seem still so strong but are increasingly challenged by the failure of the expected power shutdowns. increased restrictions that haven't eventuated. Will they double down by finding every sudden death to prove everyone is dying and will be depopulated in five years or whatever.
The sad part is that there are parts of our relationship that are better than ever.. the stress and possibility of it breaking has led them to deal with issues that made it quite hard in the past. Something they explicitly admitted.
I see them as fundamentally a good and lovely person trapped in a horrific experience they can't and at the moment don't want to get out of.. but I can't help.looking at what they went through .. their experiences and thinking well I understand how they ended up there.
Life goes one. is faith and belief and hope that it will be alright in the end enough?

Hi everyone. I met my girlfriend a while ago on a dating app where she was asking for someone to pretend to take her on a few dates so she could get vaccinated without her parents knowing. Long story short we did end up actually dating! I thought her parents were just “regular” anti vaxx folks but it turned out they’re actually full on qanoon believers.
We moved in with each other recently (I know, but lesbian uhauling + due to some personal reasons it’d be difficult for her to find a random roommate) and I’m really starting to see how her parents beliefs, specifically her mothers, have taken a toll on her mentally and emotionally. She was close with her mom, they have matching tattoos. Now though, qanon stuff is all her mom talks about and it's gotten to the point where they haven’t spoken in a few weeks. My girlfriend does have a therapist but I can see this is making her depressed. She told me that it feels like she's lost her mother entirely.
How do I help her? I love her and want to be there for her but I have no experience in this area and never know what to say. I thought people on this subreddit might know what to do. Thank you ahead of time

My sister and parents used to be about the COVID conspiracies and that’s it. Now they’re on about this new world order, brain implants, mind control and Rumpelstiltskin and I have lost them completely. Luckily They know I don’t want to talk about these things (though they don’t understand) and they hold back. That causes a distance that never used to be there and I am scared for their sanity. Especially my mother who never used to talk about politics or conspiracies AT ALL. She’s now full of them. Which causes awkward silences because I refuse to engage and she keeps telling me she’s sorry for me that I don’t see the truth. Something like that. I hate it.
There are too many reactions to respond to everyone individually, so I’ll just say it here. Thank you. It helps to know that I’m not alone in this, which is how I found this sub in the first place. I am not trying to make them ‘see the light’, I don’t want to engage with them on their views in any way. Sometimes I feel like I have to and I just end up saying the complete opposite to what they’re saying even if I don’t believe that myself. Just to make them shut up. Which usually works, but is not how I want to communicate with them.
